# Learning Log for Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies, DeFi, Ethereum & Solidity

Throughout 2022 I will try to learn something new in the fields listed below every single day, no
matter how small or obvious to others it might be. I will try to make a short summary every day
and put in references/links which might be helpful to others.

Topics for learning:
- Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies in general
- Ethereum
- Decentralized Finance
- Solidity programming
- Miner/Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), Flashbots, Searchers

My starting position:
- Programming experience in Python/C++ in other fields (Robotics, Autonomous Driving)
- Basic understanding of Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies (observing the field for 3-4 years now)
- Very basic knowledge of solidity

Goals:
- Become comfortable with solidity
- More in depth unterstanding of Ethereum and the EVM
- Knowledge of the DeFi landscape
- Start research into MEV and maybe even build first searcher bot (profitable or not)
